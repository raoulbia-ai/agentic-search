# Project Architecture

This document provides a detailed overview of the architecture of the Agentic Github Copilot Extension. The architecture is designed to be modular, scalable, and easy to understand.

## Overview

The Agentic Github Copilot Extension is built using a combination of modern web technologies and cloud services. The main components of the architecture include:

- **Frontend**: The user interface of the extension, built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- **Backend**: The server-side logic, implemented using Node.js and Express.
- **Database**: A cloud-based database for storing user data and application state.
- **External APIs**: Integration with external services such as OpenAI, GitHub, and Exa AI.

## Components

### Frontend

The frontend of the extension is responsible for rendering the user interface and handling user interactions. It is built using standard web technologies and follows a component-based architecture.

### Backend

The backend is implemented using Node.js and Express. It handles the core logic of the extension, including API requests, data processing, and communication with external services.

### Database

The extension uses a cloud-based database to store user data and application state. This ensures that the data is always available and can be accessed from anywhere.

### External APIs

The extension integrates with several external APIs to provide advanced functionality. These include:

- **OpenAI**: For generating intelligent code suggestions and completions.
- **GitHub**: For accessing user repositories and other GitHub-related data.
- **Exa AI**: For performing advanced searches and retrieving relevant information.
